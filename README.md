This script was created so I can familiarize myself with pandas library and should not be used as financial advise. This script backtests multiple strategies on a casino 
game where there is a 50/50 percent chance of winning $1 or losing $1. The code then returns a dataframe with all of the strategies reurns after x trials and the
probability that the strategy wins or losses. It also provides a visual graph that displays the returns if the game was played with no strategy and with the strategies.
